  <div class="container">

    Registration and security
    You must be over eighteen years of age to register on our website and must ensure that the details provided by you on registration are true, accurate, current and complete. It is your responsibility to update and inform us of any changes to the details provided on registration. Although certain parts of our website may be used by anyone who visits without requiring registration, some of the Services require you to register in order to enable us to verify your identity.

    By registering with the service, you agree that we can send you emails about your account, other PrimeLocation services and occasional third party offers. You can manage your communication preferences or unsubscribe from communications at any time via the myPrimeLocation section of the website.

    When registering, you will be asked to create a password and will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and restricting access to your computer, as you will be accountable for any activities conducted under your password. If you believe that someone has accessed your account without authorisation, please contact us immediately.

    Materials you provide
    By submitting content on our website or otherwise providing content to us in connection with the Services ('Materials'), you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and non-exclusive right and license to (a) use, reproduce, distribute, display, modify and edit these Materials in connection with the Services and (b) sublicense these rights. We will not pay you any fees for these Materials and reserve the right in our sole discretion to remove or edit them at any time. You also warrant and represent that you have all rights necessary to grant us these rights. We permit you to post Materials on our website in accordance with our procedures provided that the content is not illegal, obscene, abusive, threatening, defamatory or otherwise objectionable to us.

    Your responsibilities
    We are not an estate agency and we provide a service whereby agents may market and you may view property details ('Details') together with other content hosted and developed by us. Agents are responsible for preparing the Details and fielding enquiries directly from you. We do not get involved in any communications between you and agents and we do not participate in any part of the transaction.

    Details are hosted by us in good faith but are produced directly by agents and have not been verified by us. You are responsible for making your own enquiries and we provide no guarantee and accept no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information contained within the Details.

    You are responsible for checking, confirming and satisfying yourself as to the accuracy of any Details.
    You are responsible for instructing a surveyor and obtaining legal advice before committing to any purchase.
    You are responsible for ensuring that you act in good faith towards any other parties.
    Availability of website
    We strive to ensure that our website and the Services are available to you at all times but cannot guarantee that either the website or the Services will operate continuously, without interruptions or be fault free. On occasion, necessary maintenance or upgrade work requires us to make the website and the Services unavailable without notice, but we aim to keep downtime to a minimum. We accept no liability for any interruption or loss of service. We reserve the absolute right to alter, suspend or discontinue any part of our website or the Services, including your access to it.
